# treeRchitecture
This repo calculates tree architecture metrics from cylinder models (QSMs) in R. 

treeRchitecture_example.R provides and example workflow
treeRchitecture_functions.R provides the necessary functions
example_data provides some QSMs to work with initially (currently in .mat format)

The QSMs must be built using Pasi Raumonen's TreeQSM https://github.com/InverseTampere/TreeQSM and the functions here are built from (and may be merged with) Allie Shenkins treestruct https://github.com/ashenkin/treestruct.
